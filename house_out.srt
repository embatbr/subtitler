00:00:08,652 --> 00:00:10,780
[siren blaring]

2
00:00:11,405 --> 00:00:13,491
[dog barking]

3
00:00:23,209 --> 00:00:27,129
[helicopter overhead]

4
00:00:59,161 --> 00:01:01,872
[panting]

5
00:02:52,858 --> 00:02:55,486
We could jump in the car, if...

6
00:02:55,611 --> 00:02:57,404
We'll wait.

7
00:02:59,323 --> 00:03:00,532
Did you get the congressman

8
00:03:00,532 --> 00:03:02,534
- anything for his birthday?
- No.

9
00:03:02,951 --> 00:03:04,995
I got him cuff links.

10
00:03:05,120 --> 00:03:07,623
- Silver, with his...
- We don't talk about birthdays.

11
00:03:07,664 --> 00:03:10,084
- We don't do gifts.
- Why not?

12
00:03:10,584 --> 00:03:12,878
You should return the cuff links.

13
00:03:13,003 --> 00:03:14,588
[Frank] Doug.

14
00:03:15,005 --> 00:03:16,715
Tried calling you.

15
00:03:16,757 --> 00:03:19,009
- I left my phone in the...
- We need to talk.

16
00:03:22,638 --> 00:03:24,765
- What's going on?
- Christina.

17
00:03:24,807 --> 00:03:27,226
- I just spoke to her.
- Did Zoe?

18
00:03:27,267 --> 00:03:28,852
Yeah, and that's not all.

19
00:03:28,894 --> 00:03:30,562
They tracked down Rachel, too.

20
00:03:30,687 --> 00:03:32,105
Francis.

21
00:03:32,898 --> 00:03:34,650
Tell me about Rachel.

22
00:03:34,817 --> 00:03:35,818
Where is she?

23
00:03:35,818 --> 00:03:37,236
I have her under control.

24
00:03:37,361 --> 00:03:38,737
That's not what I asked.

25
00:03:38,987 --> 00:03:40,447
I drove her home.

26
00:03:40,572 --> 00:03:41,824
We don't have to worry about her.

27
00:03:41,865 --> 00:03:43,826
You said the same about Ms. Skorsky.

28
00:03:45,244 --> 00:03:46,912
Anyone else involved?

29
00:03:46,954 --> 00:03:48,330
Just Janine and Zoe.

30
00:03:48,372 --> 00:03:49,665
They asked about Russo's arrest,

31
00:03:49,665 --> 00:03:51,250
and they know he went to see Kapeniak.

32
00:03:51,500 --> 00:03:53,252
I assume that's as far as they've gotten.

33
00:03:53,293 --> 00:03:54,878
Assume nothing.

34
00:03:54,920 --> 00:03:56,338
I'll alert Barney Hull.

35
00:03:56,588 --> 00:03:59,132
- What do you want me to do about Zoe?
- I'll handle Zoe.

36
00:03:59,800 --> 00:04:01,426
- Get to work.
- Yes, sir.

37
00:04:14,356 --> 00:04:15,816
I emptied it.

38
00:04:16,441 --> 00:04:18,694
You're another year older on Tuesday.

39
00:04:18,777 --> 00:04:21,613
And we can't have a vice
president who smokes.

40
00:04:30,414 --> 00:04:32,207
[grunting]

41
00:04:32,583 --> 00:04:34,710
- Can you finish?
- What?

42
00:04:35,544 --> 00:04:37,296
I'm good.

43
00:04:38,046 --> 00:04:39,673
What's wrong?

44
00:04:39,965 --> 00:04:42,050
Nothing. I just said finish.

45
00:04:42,092 --> 00:04:44,469
Well, I don't want to
just... if you're not...

46
00:04:44,595 --> 00:04:46,680
Ok, fine.

47
00:04:46,722 --> 00:04:47,764
Whatever.

48
00:04:50,642 --> 00:04:52,603
Zoe, did I do something that made you... ?

49
00:04:52,644 --> 00:04:53,395
No.

50
00:04:54,730 --> 00:04:56,231
Zoe, you can't say something like

51
00:04:56,273 --> 00:04:59,026
"just finish" and then shut down.

52
00:05:06,199 --> 00:05:09,244
This is safe, Zoe. I'm not him.

53
00:05:17,169 --> 00:05:19,379
Good morning, Jackie.

54
00:05:20,714 --> 00:05:22,716
Good morning.

55
00:05:25,218 --> 00:05:26,386
Richard Russell?

56
00:05:26,428 --> 00:05:28,889
Civil Rights Act, 1963.

57
00:05:29,181 --> 00:05:31,350
Not everyone can be on
the right side of history.

58
00:05:31,350 --> 00:05:32,976
Not even Lyndon for a time,

59
00:05:33,018 --> 00:05:35,562
but he would've never become
majority leader without him.

60
00:05:36,021 --> 00:05:38,023
Well, there's no Johnson Senate building.

61
00:05:38,065 --> 00:05:40,901
No, he had to settle for
a presidential library.

62
00:05:41,401 --> 00:05:42,569
So it's been some time

63
00:05:42,611 --> 00:05:44,237
since you and I have
had a chance to catch up.

64
00:05:44,279 --> 00:05:46,239
You've been an outstanding deputy, Jackie.

65
00:05:46,239 --> 00:05:48,950
Far more effective than your
more seasoned colleagues.

66
00:05:49,076 --> 00:05:50,327
You're a coalition builder,

67
00:05:50,327 --> 00:05:51,912
a fighter when you have to be.

68
00:05:52,579 --> 00:05:54,956
Tell me, where do you see yourself headed?

69
00:05:56,374 --> 00:05:59,377
I'd like to aim for the
chair of Armed Services.

70
00:05:59,377 --> 00:06:00,879
Or Homeland Security.

71
00:06:01,088 --> 00:06:03,507
Have you ever considered
serving in the leadership?

72
00:06:04,508 --> 00:06:06,718
I figure that might be possible eight,

73
00:06:06,760 --> 00:06:07,677
ten years from now.

74
00:06:07,719 --> 00:06:09,888
What if I suggested that you
could serve in the leadership

75
00:06:09,888 --> 00:06:11,348
this term?

76
00:06:11,681 --> 00:06:13,183
To replace me,

77
00:06:13,433 --> 00:06:14,309
as whip.

78
00:06:16,394 --> 00:06:17,938
You're being tapped for VP.

79
00:06:17,979 --> 00:06:19,523
Let's assume that's true.

80
00:06:20,190 --> 00:06:21,316
That makes sense,

81
00:06:21,358 --> 00:06:23,193
but me as whip?

82
00:06:23,276 --> 00:06:23,985
Yes.

83
00:06:24,236 --> 00:06:25,654
A third-term congresswoman?

84
00:06:25,695 --> 00:06:27,239
A universally admired incumbent

85
00:06:27,239 --> 00:06:30,283
who also happens to be a war veteran.

86
00:06:30,325 --> 00:06:31,785
Webb is next in line.

87
00:06:31,827 --> 00:06:33,245
Or Buchwalter.

88
00:06:33,787 --> 00:06:34,955
Mmm-hmm.

89
00:06:35,580 --> 00:06:38,500
So just consider that for a moment.

90
00:06:42,129 --> 00:06:44,089
They'll draw votes from one another.

91
00:06:45,131 --> 00:06:47,092
Oh, I'm not saying you
wouldn't have to fight for it.

92
00:06:47,092 --> 00:06:49,135
But I'd be willing to
give you the ammunition.

93
00:06:51,137 --> 00:06:52,889
Come over here.

94
00:06:58,770 --> 00:07:00,313
What is this?

95
00:07:00,689 --> 00:07:03,483
My files on Webb and Buchwalter.

96
00:07:03,608 --> 00:07:05,026
Why don't you take a look?

97
00:07:05,235 --> 00:07:07,195
We'll speak in a few days.

98
00:07:07,654 --> 00:07:09,573
Oh, and there's one on you.

99
00:07:09,614 --> 00:07:12,117
You might wanna begin by
reading that one first.

100
00:07:32,262 --> 00:07:33,930
[phone dinging]

101
00:07:34,055 --> 00:07:35,515
What'd Janine say?

102
00:07:35,557 --> 00:07:37,309
Strip club's not open yet.

103
00:07:37,684 --> 00:07:39,352
You look into Kapeniak?

104
00:07:39,477 --> 00:07:41,229
If he's on the grid, I'll find him.

105
00:07:43,273 --> 00:07:44,733
Drop me at Metro Center.

106
00:07:44,816 --> 00:07:46,026
Not the office?

107
00:07:46,735 --> 00:07:48,653
I'm gonna talk to Rachel.

108
00:07:49,112 --> 00:07:50,155
She'll deny everything,

109
00:07:50,196 --> 00:07:51,406
like she did last night.

110
00:07:51,406 --> 00:07:54,492
She can't deny getting into
Stamper's car. You saw her.

111
00:07:55,785 --> 00:07:58,413
Maybe you send a version
of the story about her dad.

112
00:07:58,705 --> 00:08:00,415
No one would print it.

113
00:08:00,874 --> 00:08:02,751
Rachel doesn't know that.

114
00:08:02,834 --> 00:08:04,878
She said, "Go to town, bitch."

115
00:08:04,919 --> 00:08:07,505
It won't work. I have to get in her face.

116
00:08:11,384 --> 00:08:12,761
[phone ringing]

117
00:08:12,844 --> 00:08:14,179
Congratulations.

118
00:08:16,139 --> 00:08:17,891
- We're thrilled for you.
- Thank you.

119
00:08:17,891 --> 00:08:19,851
I wanted to fill in Bob
and Terry personally.

120
00:08:19,976 --> 00:08:21,394
Now, let's get to it.

121
00:08:21,519 --> 00:08:23,688
- I have to leave for Pittsburgh in what?
- Twenty minutes.

122
00:08:23,730 --> 00:08:25,815
Homestretch with Jim. Whistle-stop tour.

123
00:08:25,815 --> 00:08:26,858
Looking good out there.

124
00:08:26,858 --> 00:08:28,735
Very good, but we don't
want to take any chances.

125
00:08:28,777 --> 00:08:30,487
Now, your replacement as whip, Frank.

126
00:08:30,612 --> 00:08:32,280
Bob has already shared some thoughts.

127
00:08:32,364 --> 00:08:34,866
- I like Howard Webb.
- Webb is a solid choice.

128
00:08:34,866 --> 00:08:36,326
Have you thought about Wes Buchwalter?

129
00:08:36,368 --> 00:08:37,744
Buchwalter's a hothead.

130
00:08:37,827 --> 00:08:39,579
Well, could you live with Webb, Frank?

131
00:08:39,788 --> 00:08:41,289
Webb is a good tactician,

132
00:08:41,331 --> 00:08:42,582
but he lacks follow-through.

133
00:08:42,624 --> 00:08:43,958
The problem with Buchwalter is,

134
00:08:43,958 --> 00:08:46,544
he's too abrasive. No
charm. Lots of enemies.

135
00:08:46,586 --> 00:08:47,670
Is there a third option?

136
00:08:47,670 --> 00:08:50,256
They're the two most senior members
in the caucus. It's their turn.

137
00:08:50,298 --> 00:08:52,384
Mr. President, what if
we let the caucus pick?

138
00:08:52,425 --> 00:08:53,802
Let it be a wide open race.

139
00:08:53,843 --> 00:08:55,053
Both men are qualified.

140
00:08:55,053 --> 00:08:56,805
The leadership should be united in this.

141
00:08:56,805 --> 00:08:58,473
We don't want to be backing
different candidates.

142
00:08:58,473 --> 00:09:00,850
So we stay out of it, and
neither of us backs anyone.

143
00:09:00,892 --> 00:09:01,518
I like it.

144
00:09:01,559 --> 00:09:02,852
The caucus will respect someone who

145
00:09:02,852 --> 00:09:04,229
did it the old-fashioned way.

146
00:09:04,687 --> 00:09:06,815
[Walker] Well, gentlemen,
it's your call to make.

147
00:09:06,898 --> 00:09:08,233
Figure it out amongst yourselves,

148
00:09:08,274 --> 00:09:10,610
- let me know what you decide.
- Thank you, Mr. President.

149
00:09:12,028 --> 00:09:13,905
Put me through to Secretary Lewis.

150
00:09:14,739 --> 00:09:17,242
Frank, I don't want to go
to battle with you on this.

151
00:09:17,242 --> 00:09:19,452
- We've been down that road.
- I couldn't agree more.

152
00:09:19,494 --> 00:09:20,912
An open race makes me nervous.

153
00:09:20,912 --> 00:09:22,914
Look, it was just a suggestion.

154
00:09:23,498 --> 00:09:26,167
- I'll put some thought into it.
- Thank you.

155
00:09:28,378 --> 00:09:30,713
You know, let me... let me go work on him.

156
00:09:30,755 --> 00:09:32,549
Well, good luck.

157
00:09:35,009 --> 00:09:37,011
[indistinct chatter]

158
00:09:44,769 --> 00:09:46,229
What are you doing here?

159
00:09:46,271 --> 00:09:48,481
Ask me what I want to order.

160
00:09:55,196 --> 00:09:56,447
Have you decided, sir?

161
00:09:56,447 --> 00:09:57,782
I need you to quit your job.

162
00:09:57,782 --> 00:09:59,409
Tell Leon it's your last day.

163
00:09:59,784 --> 00:10:00,869
Why?

164
00:10:00,994 --> 00:10:02,662
Act normal.

165
00:10:06,249 --> 00:10:08,459
- Would you want a side with that?
- They found you once.

166
00:10:08,501 --> 00:10:10,169
We can't take the chance
they'll find you again.

167
00:10:10,169 --> 00:10:12,839
- What am I supposed to do about money?
- Do as I say.

168
00:10:13,006 --> 00:10:14,966
Go home and pack your things.

169
00:10:15,091 --> 00:10:16,384
I'll come by around ten.

170
00:10:16,384 --> 00:10:18,386
- I don't get a say in any... ?
- Stop it.

171
00:10:24,684 --> 00:10:27,145
One suitcase. That's it.

172
00:10:27,395 --> 00:10:29,355
- Can you at least tell me... ?
- I'll take the shepherd's pie

173
00:10:29,355 --> 00:10:31,274
with a side of brussels sprouts.

174
00:10:31,900 --> 00:10:33,109
To go.

175
00:10:34,861 --> 00:10:36,321
We don't want a trial,

176
00:10:36,362 --> 00:10:37,822
her lawyers don't want a trial,

177
00:10:37,864 --> 00:10:39,699
but Ms. Cole won't listen to reason.

178
00:10:39,824 --> 00:10:41,826
That said, if you give
me a little more time...

179
00:10:41,826 --> 00:10:42,702
If she wants to go to court,

180
00:10:42,744 --> 00:10:43,786
then let's give her that.

181
00:10:43,828 --> 00:10:46,039
Just because she's being
unreasonable now doesn't mean...

182
00:10:46,080 --> 00:10:46,956
- she's...
- I'm done.

183
00:10:46,998 --> 00:10:48,499
That's a knee-jerk reaction.

184
00:10:48,541 --> 00:10:51,586
I've never known you to be a person
who is irrational or impatient.

185
00:10:51,628 --> 00:10:52,921
Let me check back with her lawyers...

186
00:10:52,921 --> 00:10:55,048
What's the soonest we can get a trial date?

187
00:10:55,089 --> 00:10:56,966
- Claire.
- Give me a time frame.

188
00:10:57,216 --> 00:10:59,344
Six months, at the earliest.

189
00:11:02,055 --> 00:11:03,514
Inform her people.

190
00:11:03,556 --> 00:11:06,017
Then no more communication.

191
00:11:06,476 --> 00:11:08,186
As your counsel, it is my duty

192
00:11:08,186 --> 00:11:10,146
to strongly advise you against this.

193
00:11:10,355 --> 00:11:12,732
I understand and I thank you, Oliver.

194
00:11:16,778 --> 00:11:18,154
Thank you.

195
00:11:19,405 --> 00:11:20,365
So?

196
00:11:20,406 --> 00:11:22,784
They wouldn't give me
individual contact info,

197
00:11:22,825 --> 00:11:24,535
but here's every doctor

198
00:11:24,535 --> 00:11:27,038
who served in East Africa
during the last three years.

199
00:11:27,080 --> 00:11:28,414
And what about the HMO?

200
00:11:28,456 --> 00:11:29,874
You need a consent form.

201
00:11:29,916 --> 00:11:31,209
It's in the packet.

202
00:11:42,470 --> 00:11:43,680
Can I help you?

203
00:11:44,222 --> 00:11:46,766
Yeah, I'm looking for Rachel Posner.

204
00:11:46,891 --> 00:11:48,684
She's not here.

205
00:11:48,726 --> 00:11:51,270
- Is she coming in later?
- Why?

206
00:11:51,687 --> 00:11:53,189
I know her.

207
00:11:53,314 --> 00:11:55,483
Well, your friend really screwed me over.

208
00:11:55,525 --> 00:11:56,609
What happened?

209
00:11:56,651 --> 00:11:59,112
She took off, middle of her shift.

210
00:11:59,445 --> 00:12:01,906
I had to put my hostess on waitstaff duty.

211
00:12:02,240 --> 00:12:03,699
Look, I'm concerned.

212
00:12:03,699 --> 00:12:05,326
Rachel's in real trouble.

213
00:12:05,368 --> 00:12:07,286
I don't care what her personal issues are.

214
00:12:07,328 --> 00:12:08,746
I need to know where she lives.

215
00:12:08,788 --> 00:12:09,789
I thought you knew her.

216
00:12:09,831 --> 00:12:12,667
I do. It's just been a while and...

217
00:12:12,792 --> 00:12:16,003
she sent me a text message saying
she wants to hurt herself, and

218
00:12:16,087 --> 00:12:18,214
now she won't answer her phone.

219
00:12:18,464 --> 00:12:20,842
She has a history of mental illness.

220
00:12:21,384 --> 00:12:23,261
You gotta help me out.

221
00:12:30,101 --> 00:12:31,769
Look, I can't.

222
00:12:32,603 --> 00:12:33,604
Her W-2,

223
00:12:33,646 --> 00:12:34,814
the address is a PO box.

224
00:12:34,856 --> 00:12:36,357
I'll take whatever I can get.

225
00:12:38,609 --> 00:12:40,611
- Let me see what I got in the office.
- Thank you.

226
00:12:40,611 --> 00:12:41,863
If you find her,

227
00:12:41,988 --> 00:12:43,739
you tell her not to come back.

228
00:12:43,865 --> 00:12:46,826
I don't need some nut case
creating chaos in here.

229
00:12:49,370 --> 00:12:51,038
- Nancy?
- Yes, sir.

230
00:12:51,038 --> 00:12:52,957
- Is Doug back yet?
- In his office.

231
00:12:53,207 --> 00:12:54,292
And, sir?

232
00:12:54,667 --> 00:12:57,378
Birthday cards have started
to arrive. A few presents.

233
00:12:57,420 --> 00:12:59,672
Thank-you notes. Inventory the
presents. Anything valuable...

234
00:12:59,714 --> 00:13:01,382
- Goes in the conference room.
- Anything cheap...

235
00:13:01,382 --> 00:13:03,593
- Goes to the interns.
- You know what to do with the cards.

236
00:13:03,634 --> 00:13:05,261
Yes, sir.

237
00:13:12,310 --> 00:13:13,936
I'm picking her up tonight.

238
00:13:14,061 --> 00:13:15,813
I got everything set up for her in Joppa.

239
00:13:15,938 --> 00:13:17,732
- Where's that?
- Maryland,

240
00:13:17,773 --> 00:13:19,442
about 30 minutes north of Baltimore.

241
00:13:19,567 --> 00:13:20,902
That's close to home.

242
00:13:20,902 --> 00:13:22,153
We want her to disappear,

243
00:13:22,195 --> 00:13:23,571
but not on us.

244
00:13:23,696 --> 00:13:26,032
- Fine. Do you have the burner?
- Yeah.

245
00:13:34,999 --> 00:13:36,751
Happy birthday.

246
00:13:37,877 --> 00:13:40,713
It's pre-paid. All you need
to do is turn it on and dial.

247
00:13:40,796 --> 00:13:42,131
We still have the phone history.

248
00:13:42,256 --> 00:13:44,550
All the more reason to
be safe going forward.

249
00:13:44,675 --> 00:13:47,011
- Where are we with Christina?
- I'm on it.

250
00:13:47,053 --> 00:13:48,262
Linda's office.

251
00:13:48,387 --> 00:13:50,222
I called her this morning.

252
00:13:54,602 --> 00:13:56,312
Are you Gillian Cole?

253
00:13:56,354 --> 00:13:59,148
Yeah. Have we met?

254
00:13:59,732 --> 00:14:01,859
No, we haven't met. You know my husband.

255
00:14:01,901 --> 00:14:04,445
- Your husband?
- David Applebaum.

256
00:14:06,489 --> 00:14:09,325
- So it's true.
- It was a mistake.

257
00:14:09,784 --> 00:14:11,327
You wanna see our kids?

258
00:14:11,410 --> 00:14:12,787
I can show you pictures.

259
00:14:12,912 --> 00:14:15,373
- Mrs. Applebaum...
- Who the fuck do you think you are?

260
00:14:15,414 --> 00:14:16,457
I'm sorry.

261
00:14:16,582 --> 00:14:18,668
You're sorry? I don't think you're sorry.

262
00:14:18,709 --> 00:14:20,211
And don't think for a second

263
00:14:20,252 --> 00:14:22,088
you're gonna use that baby
to get money out of us.

264
00:14:22,129 --> 00:14:24,924
- He doesn't even know I'm pregnant.
- But you knew he was married.

265
00:14:25,383 --> 00:14:26,634
How could you?

266
00:14:26,759 --> 00:14:28,427
- Did he talk about us?
- No.

267
00:14:28,427 --> 00:14:29,762
Lying bitch.

268
00:14:29,887 --> 00:14:31,681
Am I embarrassing you?

269
00:14:31,681 --> 00:14:33,474
Did you think about how you would...

270
00:14:33,516 --> 00:14:35,726
humiliate me and my kids?

271
00:14:36,519 --> 00:14:37,561
Use a condom

272
00:14:37,561 --> 00:14:39,855
the next time you fuck somebody's husband.

273
00:15:06,841 --> 00:15:08,718
[Zoe] It's been less than 24 hours.

274
00:15:08,759 --> 00:15:10,678
She quits her job in the middle of a shift?

275
00:15:10,719 --> 00:15:12,721
[Janine] She's scared. I'd take off too.

276
00:15:12,763 --> 00:15:13,973
[Zoe] It's Underwood.

277
00:15:14,014 --> 00:15:15,891
He's moving faster than we are.

278
00:15:15,933 --> 00:15:17,184
[Lucas] What about the stripper?

279
00:15:17,226 --> 00:15:19,019
[Janine] Refuses to talk.

280
00:15:19,019 --> 00:15:20,229
[Zoe] Kapeniak?

281
00:15:20,271 --> 00:15:22,690
[Lucas] No current address.
No siblings. Parents are dead.

282
00:15:23,107 --> 00:15:24,775
[Zoe] Rachel's the last loose end.

283
00:15:24,900 --> 00:15:26,318
She must know something else

284
00:15:26,360 --> 00:15:27,820
bigger than the DUI.

285
00:15:27,820 --> 00:15:29,780
Any idea where she went?

286
00:15:29,905 --> 00:15:31,615
I got a PO box in Dupont.

287
00:15:31,615 --> 00:15:32,992
But none of the clerks have seen her.

288
00:15:33,033 --> 00:15:34,618
I could go stake it out, but...

289
00:15:34,743 --> 00:15:36,620
Have you talked to your guy yet?

290
00:15:36,620 --> 00:15:37,788
The next day or two.

291
00:15:37,913 --> 00:15:40,624
He's bringing me the police
report on Russo's suicide.

292
00:15:40,666 --> 00:15:41,876
I'll press him for more.

293
00:15:41,876 --> 00:15:43,252
And what's your next move?

294
00:15:43,502 --> 00:15:45,796
Trying to figure out
how to respond to this.

295
00:15:48,007 --> 00:15:49,842
I got it a couple hours ago.

296
00:15:51,218 --> 00:15:52,803
I think he's setting her up.

297
00:15:52,928 --> 00:15:54,680
I know how to handle him.

298
00:15:54,805 --> 00:15:57,183
- The less he knows, the better.
- We might learn something.

299
00:15:57,224 --> 00:15:58,392
Not with him calling the shots.

300
00:15:58,434 --> 00:15:59,768
I'm choosing the place.

301
00:15:59,768 --> 00:16:01,854
- As if that makes a difference.
- I'm not gonna fuck him,

302
00:16:01,854 --> 00:16:03,439
just talk to him.

303
00:16:08,611 --> 00:16:10,613
I'm gonna go to the bathroom.

304
00:16:12,031 --> 00:16:13,532
- I'm sorry, I shouldn't have...
- That's ok.

305
00:16:13,574 --> 00:16:14,992
No, it's not.

306
00:16:15,534 --> 00:16:18,287
- I just don't want you to be careless.
- I won't be.

307
00:16:19,121 --> 00:16:20,706
You want no life?

308
00:16:21,790 --> 00:16:26,045
You want more work than
three people can handle?

309
00:16:26,086 --> 00:16:29,465
You want a decent chance that you
could be fired within the first month?

310
00:16:30,007 --> 00:16:31,675
If that tempts you,

311
00:16:32,009 --> 00:16:34,511
- we can keep talking.
- None of that intimidates me.

312
00:16:34,595 --> 00:16:36,347
I've been running a congressional district

313
00:16:36,388 --> 00:16:37,431
for the past nine weeks

314
00:16:37,514 --> 00:16:39,058
with zero assistance.

315
00:16:39,183 --> 00:16:41,727
Nobody elected me. Nobody taught me.

316
00:16:41,769 --> 00:16:43,896
I've done it because somebody had to.

317
00:16:43,896 --> 00:16:46,357
What happened was tragic, but

318
00:16:46,398 --> 00:16:48,108
you won't get sympathy from me.

319
00:16:48,150 --> 00:16:49,568
I don't have time for it.

320
00:16:49,693 --> 00:16:51,028
I wouldn't be sitting here

321
00:16:51,070 --> 00:16:53,113
if I wanted a shoulder to cry on.

322
00:16:54,031 --> 00:16:56,033
[knocking]

323
00:16:58,994 --> 00:17:00,454
[Doug] Rachel?

324
00:17:05,751 --> 00:17:08,170
[clicking]

325
00:17:16,011 --> 00:17:17,513
[Rachel] Leave.

326
00:17:29,108 --> 00:17:30,985
I said leave.

327
00:17:32,778 --> 00:17:35,489
- Are you packed?
- I'm not going anywhere.

328
00:17:37,074 --> 00:17:38,701
So you didn't quit today.

329
00:17:39,410 --> 00:17:41,328
I did, but I changed my mind.

330
00:17:42,371 --> 00:17:44,164
This isn't your decision to make.

331
00:17:44,456 --> 00:17:45,791
I'm keeping my job

332
00:17:45,916 --> 00:17:47,501
and I'm keeping this apartment.

333
00:17:47,626 --> 00:17:49,211
No, you're not.

334
00:17:50,170 --> 00:17:53,090
- You promised you'd make this go away.
- And you're starting over...

335
00:17:53,132 --> 00:17:55,718
I already started over. I
don't want to start over again.

336
00:17:56,969 --> 00:17:58,512
I wish you didn't have to.

337
00:18:00,139 --> 00:18:01,557
Get out.

338
00:18:03,183 --> 00:18:04,476
Get out!

339
00:18:04,476 --> 00:18:06,145
Lower your voice.

340
00:18:08,772 --> 00:18:10,399
I'll fucking kill you.

341
00:18:10,774 --> 00:18:12,359
Go ahead.

342
00:18:13,652 --> 00:18:15,487
[gasps]

343
00:18:18,198 --> 00:18:21,076
[panting]

344
00:18:21,452 --> 00:18:24,788
I am the only one who can
protect you. Don't you see that?

345
00:18:26,415 --> 00:18:28,834
You have no idea how much danger you're in.

346
00:18:30,919 --> 00:18:33,505
[sobbing]

347
00:18:45,142 --> 00:18:46,393
Hey.

348
00:18:47,519 --> 00:18:48,896
Start packing.

349
00:18:58,822 --> 00:19:00,657
You know I ask every year.

350
00:19:00,699 --> 00:19:02,493
Nothing, as usual.

351
00:19:05,204 --> 00:19:06,580
I thought we could have dinner.

352
00:19:06,580 --> 00:19:08,832
Only if it's someplace where
nobody will recognize us.

353
00:19:08,832 --> 00:19:10,876
- I don't want anyone...
- I mean at home.

354
00:19:10,918 --> 00:19:12,252
I'll cook something.

355
00:19:13,378 --> 00:19:14,671
No cake.

356
00:19:14,713 --> 00:19:16,089
- No cake.
- No gifts.

357
00:19:16,131 --> 00:19:17,424
No gifts.

358
00:19:17,549 --> 00:19:18,884
I could do that.

359
00:19:18,884 --> 00:19:20,344
How's the lawsuit coming?

360
00:19:20,385 --> 00:19:21,803
We'll be fine.

361
00:19:22,387 --> 00:19:24,514
We'd like to increase
the size of your detail

362
00:19:24,556 --> 00:19:26,934
to full head-of-state
status starting tomorrow.

363
00:19:26,975 --> 00:19:29,228
Well, that won't be happening.

364
00:19:29,561 --> 00:19:30,812
It's good to get a head start,

365
00:19:30,812 --> 00:19:33,148
- so by the time the announcement...
- If these are my last few days

366
00:19:33,190 --> 00:19:34,858
before I never have privacy again.

367
00:19:34,900 --> 00:19:37,527
I intend to savor these
moments for as long as I can.

368
00:19:37,569 --> 00:19:38,904
But, sir, in terms of safety...

369
00:19:38,904 --> 00:19:40,781
Until I'm confirmed as vice president,

370
00:19:40,822 --> 00:19:43,075
security is at my
discretion, is that correct?

371
00:19:43,200 --> 00:19:45,535
- Technically, yes, but...
- Then that's settled.

372
00:19:45,869 --> 00:19:47,955
All right, we'll wait
until the announcement.

373
00:19:48,288 --> 00:19:50,123
Now, assuming the
confirmation goes through,

374
00:19:50,165 --> 00:19:52,209
we'll need to work out
the logistics of moving you

375
00:19:52,251 --> 00:19:53,794
into the Naval Observatory.

376
00:19:53,835 --> 00:19:55,379
That won't be happening either.

377
00:19:55,420 --> 00:19:57,756
The congressman will be
remaining in his town house.

378
00:19:57,798 --> 00:20:00,842
But it doesn't have the
necessary security infrastructure.

379
00:20:03,595 --> 00:20:05,180
Then you'll need to build it.

380
00:20:05,597 --> 00:20:07,349
We're talking blast-proofing,

381
00:20:07,391 --> 00:20:09,226
hard-wired communications networks,

382
00:20:09,268 --> 00:20:12,354
- 24-hour office space...
- Where there's a will, there's a way.

383
00:20:12,813 --> 00:20:15,691
I'll contact you directly
about setting a plan in motion.

384
00:20:21,613 --> 00:20:23,532
Oh, and one last thing before you go.

385
00:20:23,573 --> 00:20:26,576
I'd like to have Edward
Meechum serve on my detail.

386
00:20:26,618 --> 00:20:27,953
He's Capitol Police.

387
00:20:27,995 --> 00:20:30,247
For now. You're about to appoint
him to the Secret Service.

388
00:20:30,247 --> 00:20:32,582
That would require an
accelerated training program.

389
00:20:32,624 --> 00:20:34,501
Sir, we have plenty of qualified agents,

390
00:20:34,543 --> 00:20:36,169
men and women with years of experience.

391
00:20:36,211 --> 00:20:37,629
And I look forward to
working with all of them

392
00:20:37,671 --> 00:20:39,673
as long as Edward Meechum is on the detail.

393
00:20:39,673 --> 00:20:41,425
Thank you very much for your time.

394
00:20:41,508 --> 00:20:43,051
Thank you, sir.

395
00:20:56,023 --> 00:20:58,525
Nancy, have Meechum bring the car around.

396
00:21:11,121 --> 00:21:13,248
You know, last time was the last time.

397
00:21:13,248 --> 00:21:15,500
I know, but this is important.

398
00:21:15,751 --> 00:21:18,754
You keep selling me that
swampland. I'm done buying.

399
00:21:19,671 --> 00:21:20,881
No more.

400
00:21:20,964 --> 00:21:21,590
The cover-up.

401
00:21:21,631 --> 00:21:23,300
You said it went as high as Barney Hull.

402
00:21:23,341 --> 00:21:24,426
That's not what I said.

403
00:21:24,468 --> 00:21:26,511
- When you gave me Rachel Posner's arrest file...
- What I said

404
00:21:26,553 --> 00:21:29,431
is that arrests don't disappear
without a big-ass wand.

405
00:21:29,473 --> 00:21:30,932
That ain't the same as proof.

406
00:21:30,974 --> 00:21:32,809
We think congressional
leadership took part.

407
00:21:32,851 --> 00:21:34,728
- I don't care.
- Yes, you do. I know you do.

408
00:21:34,770 --> 00:21:36,313
No, I really don't.

409
00:21:36,313 --> 00:21:37,689
When you helped me expose the drug ring...

410
00:21:37,731 --> 00:21:38,648
They were dirty street cops

411
00:21:38,648 --> 00:21:41,234
stuffing a few grams in their
pockets. This is different.

412
00:21:41,234 --> 00:21:43,862
- Powerful fucking people.
- Dirty cops are dirty cops.

413
00:21:43,904 --> 00:21:45,572
- You want to protect them?
- I have a pension

414
00:21:45,614 --> 00:21:47,157
- and a family.
- I understand, but...

415
00:21:47,199 --> 00:21:48,533
Don't contact me again.

416
00:22:41,127 --> 00:22:43,338
- Where's your cell?
- Here.

417
00:22:43,380 --> 00:22:44,965
It's not recording.

418
00:22:45,090 --> 00:22:48,301
I need to ask you to delete
all of our phone history.

419
00:22:48,343 --> 00:22:49,511
Why would I do that?

420
00:22:49,552 --> 00:22:51,263
I'm trying to protect both you and I.

421
00:22:51,263 --> 00:22:53,223
I'm not facing prison.

422
00:22:55,267 --> 00:22:57,811
You didn't cover up the arrest?

423
00:22:58,561 --> 00:23:00,981
Was it because you
wanted him to be governor?

424
00:23:01,106 --> 00:23:04,025
No. He was in trouble so I helped.

425
00:23:04,067 --> 00:23:05,986
And later he expressed a desire to run

426
00:23:05,986 --> 00:23:08,238
- and I offered guidance.
- To an alcoholic?

427
00:23:08,363 --> 00:23:10,782
To a sober, recovering alcoholic.

428
00:23:10,824 --> 00:23:13,410
Did you want him to self-sabotage?

429
00:23:13,410 --> 00:23:14,911
Absolutely not.

430
00:23:15,036 --> 00:23:17,247
It got Matthews in the race.

431
00:23:17,372 --> 00:23:20,500
I like to back people who want to succeed.

432
00:23:20,542 --> 00:23:22,294
Take yourself as an example.

433
00:23:22,335 --> 00:23:24,212
You just took advantage of the situation.

434
00:23:24,254 --> 00:23:27,465
Matthews took advantage. I
didn't seek the nomination.

435
00:23:28,633 --> 00:23:31,720
Russo was in the passenger
seat when he died.

436
00:23:34,764 --> 00:23:37,142
That's not entirely accurate.

437
00:23:37,392 --> 00:23:38,977
I saw the police report.

438
00:23:39,019 --> 00:23:41,062
And I spoke to the commissioner directly

439
00:23:41,062 --> 00:23:42,480
because I cared about Peter

440
00:23:42,480 --> 00:23:44,941
and I wanted to know the full story.

441
00:23:45,066 --> 00:23:47,152
He wasn't in the passenger seat?

442
00:23:50,697 --> 00:23:53,283
The passenger door was
open and he was halfway out.

443
00:23:53,283 --> 00:23:54,951
They think that...

444
00:23:56,202 --> 00:23:58,496
he might have had second thoughts.

445
00:23:59,497 --> 00:24:02,375
If I speak to Barney
Hull, he'll confirm that?

446
00:24:03,501 --> 00:24:05,628
What are you suggesting, Zoe?

447
00:24:05,712 --> 00:24:07,005
Maybe there was foul play.

448
00:24:07,047 --> 00:24:08,506
If there was a hint of foul play,

449
00:24:08,506 --> 00:24:10,633
don't you think the police
would have investigated?

450
00:24:10,675 --> 00:24:12,594
The same police that buried his DUI?

451
00:24:12,594 --> 00:24:14,971
And you think I was involved?

452
00:24:15,638 --> 00:24:17,557
There's a connection between you.

453
00:24:17,599 --> 00:24:19,392
Listen to you. You sound ludicrous.

454
00:24:19,392 --> 00:24:20,977
I'm just asking questions.

455
00:24:20,977 --> 00:24:23,146
No, you're connecting
dots that don't exist.

456
00:24:23,188 --> 00:24:26,357
You want me to just walk away,
act as if I don't know anything?

457
00:24:26,399 --> 00:24:28,568
Yes, I got Peter out of a jam.

458
00:24:28,568 --> 00:24:30,820
Yes, I sent him to speak to Kapeniak.

459
00:24:30,862 --> 00:24:32,906
But beyond that, there's nothing to know.

460
00:24:32,947 --> 00:24:35,533
Can you blame me if I find it
difficult to trust you right now?

461
00:24:35,575 --> 00:24:36,743
Trust me or not,

462
00:24:36,868 --> 00:24:39,662
but I'm about to be confirmed
as the vice president.

463
00:24:39,788 --> 00:24:43,208
And our relationship extends
to the Oval Office now.

464
00:24:43,249 --> 00:24:46,461
Don't step out of the
sunlight for no reason.

465
00:24:47,086 --> 00:24:50,423
Let's start this new
chapter with a clean slate.

466
00:24:52,467 --> 00:24:56,429
Now, you sleep on that
and I'll be in touch.

467
00:25:03,269 --> 00:25:05,647
<i>[woman] We'll start with
blood and hormone tests.</i>

468
00:25:05,688 --> 00:25:07,649
<i>Those results should be
back within a few days.</i>

469
00:25:07,649 --> 00:25:09,776
If they're good, we'll
move onto genetic testing

470
00:25:09,818 --> 00:25:11,277
for both you and your husband.

471
00:25:11,319 --> 00:25:13,112
Have you spoken to him yet?

472
00:25:13,154 --> 00:25:16,115
Not yet. I want to do the tests first.

473
00:25:16,157 --> 00:25:18,201
We can do those anytime this week.

474
00:25:18,201 --> 00:25:20,537
I'll have my office call yours.

475
00:25:21,246 --> 00:25:23,748
Oh, I almost forgot. I've
been doing some research

476
00:25:23,790 --> 00:25:26,125
- on the Internet.
- Be careful of the Internet.

477
00:25:26,251 --> 00:25:27,460
[chuckles]

478
00:25:27,544 --> 00:25:28,962
Well, I was looking into

479
00:25:28,962 --> 00:25:31,589
common issues associated
with post-40 pregnancies

480
00:25:31,631 --> 00:25:34,467
and this drug came up, but
there wasn't much on it. It's

481
00:25:34,717 --> 00:25:37,679
- Cruvenae...
- Cruvenae-tenuestrin.

482
00:25:37,804 --> 00:25:39,222
You probably haven't found much

483
00:25:39,264 --> 00:25:41,224
because it's still in the beta stage.

484
00:25:41,349 --> 00:25:42,976
And what does it do?

485
00:25:42,976 --> 00:25:45,853
It helps maximize blood
flow to the placenta.

486
00:25:45,979 --> 00:25:49,691
Until CVT, there hasn't been
any viable drug for that.

487
00:25:49,983 --> 00:25:51,651
The jury's still out.

488
00:25:51,776 --> 00:25:55,446
But placental insufficiency
affects women of all ages.

489
00:25:55,488 --> 00:25:57,532
I wouldn't worry about it for now.

490
00:25:57,574 --> 00:26:00,535
That's putting the cart
way before the horse.

491
00:26:01,578 --> 00:26:04,455
[water running]

492
00:26:05,373 --> 00:26:07,709
<i>- [man on TV] You know,
- Matthews has this locked up,</i>

493
00:26:07,750 --> 00:26:09,627
<i>but conservatives on the Hill are saying</i>

494
00:26:09,669 --> 00:26:11,296
<i>he's gonna return to Harrisburg</i>

495
00:26:11,337 --> 00:26:14,215
<i>with the same myopic
deficit growing mentality... </i>

496
00:26:14,590 --> 00:26:17,844
<i>[continues indistinctly]</i>

497
00:26:23,850 --> 00:26:27,020
<i>As to who's gonna replace
Matthews when he wins... </i>

498
00:26:27,145 --> 00:26:31,065
- Can I at least turn off the overhead?
- Of course.

499
00:26:32,817 --> 00:26:35,194
Do you want me to go work downstairs?

500
00:26:35,194 --> 00:26:38,323
No, that's fine. Just make some room.

501
00:26:44,495 --> 00:26:46,873
You haven't said a word.

502
00:26:47,498 --> 00:26:48,958
No.

503
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:51,127
Where does that leave us?

504
00:26:52,420 --> 00:26:54,797
I'm fully prepared.

505
00:26:55,131 --> 00:26:58,092
And I have been for some time.

506
00:27:06,893 --> 00:27:10,229
I know you'll do whatever
you think is best.

507
00:27:13,858 --> 00:27:15,526
But Underwood confirmed it.

508
00:27:15,526 --> 00:27:17,361
He's gonna be tapped for VP.

509
00:27:17,403 --> 00:27:18,529
That doesn't get us any closer.

510
00:27:18,571 --> 00:27:20,823
We know that Russo cleared
the way for Matthews.

511
00:27:20,823 --> 00:27:22,825
It reinforces the theory,
it doesn't give us proof.

512
00:27:22,867 --> 00:27:25,203
We can't go after the
guy for playing dirty.

513
00:27:25,203 --> 00:27:27,997
And that's not news. Half the
fuckers in Congress play dirty.

514
00:27:27,997 --> 00:27:30,708
He propped up a sham candidate
just to take him down.

515
00:27:30,750 --> 00:27:32,001
Nobody forced Russo to drink that night.

516
00:27:32,043 --> 00:27:34,420
- The guy was an alcoholic.
- We don't know what happened that night,

517
00:27:34,462 --> 00:27:37,131
other than three days
later, he killed himself.

518
00:27:38,132 --> 00:27:40,551
Are you gonna contact him again?

519
00:27:40,843 --> 00:27:41,886
I don't know.

520
00:27:41,928 --> 00:27:44,263
We need to slow down, take
a step back and reevaluate...

521
00:27:44,263 --> 00:27:45,556
We already let Rachel slip away.

522
00:27:45,556 --> 00:27:47,141
There's no point until we have more.

523
00:27:47,183 --> 00:27:49,811
- We should keep him guessing, not...
- Have more from where? From who?

524
00:27:49,852 --> 00:27:51,813
I don't know. We should exhaust all options

525
00:27:51,854 --> 00:27:54,357
before Zoe reaches back out to
Underwood. It looks desperate.

526
00:27:54,398 --> 00:27:56,818
We are up against a brick
wall. And unless Under...

527
00:27:56,818 --> 00:27:58,611
Zoe.

528
00:27:58,861 --> 00:28:01,364
Hey. Hey.

529
00:28:02,198 --> 00:28:04,325
Hey.

530
00:28:04,367 --> 00:28:06,035
I just need to think.

531
00:28:06,077 --> 00:28:09,205
- Well, let's think about it together.
- I'll call you tomorrow.

532
00:28:11,290 --> 00:28:12,750
Freddy?

533
00:28:12,750 --> 00:28:13,960
Yeah, Frank?

534
00:28:14,001 --> 00:28:15,336
Was there something different

535
00:28:15,378 --> 00:28:17,755
about these ribs this morning?

536
00:28:18,339 --> 00:28:20,341
Better or worse?

537
00:28:20,466 --> 00:28:23,177
I didn't think that they
could get any better,

538
00:28:23,219 --> 00:28:25,930
but these were something special.

539
00:28:26,264 --> 00:28:27,390
Well,

540
00:28:28,140 --> 00:28:30,518
tried a new butcher.

541
00:28:30,935 --> 00:28:32,728
Slow-bleeds his hogs.

542
00:28:32,728 --> 00:28:35,815
- It ain't legal, but...
- Well, I won't tell anyone.

543
00:28:35,815 --> 00:28:38,359
I don't know if I'm gonna go back to him.

544
00:28:38,484 --> 00:28:40,236
Went out to his shop.

545
00:28:40,278 --> 00:28:43,656
He's got a room in the back
where he does it. Soundproof.

546
00:28:43,698 --> 00:28:46,576
- A whole setup.
- Why soundproof?

547
00:28:46,867 --> 00:28:48,995
'Cause of how they scream.

548
00:28:49,120 --> 00:28:51,330
They can smell it comin'.

549
00:28:51,455 --> 00:28:53,833
You stick that pipe in their throat,

550
00:28:53,958 --> 00:28:55,960
next ten minutes is hell.

551
00:28:56,085 --> 00:28:57,420
Bust your fucking eardrums.

552
00:28:57,461 --> 00:29:01,090
Now, the humane way to
do it is to make it quick.

553
00:29:01,674 --> 00:29:04,635
Bring out a bucket of slop
like it's feeding time,

554
00:29:04,677 --> 00:29:09,473
then bam, shovel right
to the base of the head.

555
00:29:09,724 --> 00:29:11,601
No screamin'.

556
00:29:12,852 --> 00:29:16,856
Now, he's willing to open up the
race, but Birch was very clear:

557
00:29:16,897 --> 00:29:18,649
if he can't endorse
anyone, you can't either.

558
00:29:18,691 --> 00:29:20,026
That's fair.

559
00:29:20,067 --> 00:29:21,611
You really want Buchwalter to win?

560
00:29:21,652 --> 00:29:24,572
I want the best man to win.

561
00:29:24,780 --> 00:29:27,450
That sounds like a cagey,
bullshit non-answer to me.

562
00:29:27,450 --> 00:29:30,244
I'm on the sidelines for this one, Terry.

563
00:29:30,536 --> 00:29:32,997
You're never on the sidelines, Frank.

564
00:29:33,372 --> 00:29:36,292
I'll see you around.

565
00:29:38,627 --> 00:29:41,172
[phone dings]

566
00:29:54,560 --> 00:29:56,437
Claire,

567
00:29:56,479 --> 00:29:58,981
you wouldn't return my calls.

568
00:29:59,273 --> 00:30:00,775
I'll be back.

569
00:30:01,233 --> 00:30:05,404
My attorney said that I
shouldn't be in contact with you.

570
00:30:06,113 --> 00:30:08,824
Blue Cross said my insurance was canceled.

571
00:30:08,949 --> 00:30:10,743
Oh?

572
00:30:11,494 --> 00:30:13,746
The severance package

573
00:30:13,746 --> 00:30:16,415
gave me health coverage for up to a year.

574
00:30:16,999 --> 00:30:19,335
That sounds right.

575
00:30:19,627 --> 00:30:22,254
So there must be some kind of mistake.

576
00:30:22,546 --> 00:30:25,299
Well, you'll have to talk
to the insurance company.

577
00:30:25,299 --> 00:30:27,760
I did. They said it was terminated.

578
00:30:27,802 --> 00:30:30,054
They can't reinstate it
without the employer's approval.

579
00:30:30,096 --> 00:30:32,264
And you want me to get involved?

580
00:30:33,015 --> 00:30:35,309
There's medication that I need

581
00:30:35,434 --> 00:30:38,187
that I can't get unless
it goes through my HMO.

582
00:30:38,312 --> 00:30:39,563
Oh, I'm well aware.

583
00:30:39,605 --> 00:30:41,899
I reviewed your records.

584
00:30:42,399 --> 00:30:44,568
- What?
- You signed a consent form.

585
00:30:44,693 --> 00:30:46,737
No, I didn't.

586
00:30:52,159 --> 00:30:53,536
You forged my signature?

587
00:30:53,577 --> 00:30:56,288
Did a Mrs. Applebaum pay you a visit?

588
00:30:59,792 --> 00:31:01,168
You realize

589
00:31:01,168 --> 00:31:03,587
- what you're doing is...
- Civil,

590
00:31:03,712 --> 00:31:05,673
- not criminal.
- Have you thought this out?

591
00:31:05,714 --> 00:31:08,175
- Because when we go to court...
- You mean six months from now?

592
00:31:08,217 --> 00:31:10,553
You're expecting in four, no?

593
00:31:10,678 --> 00:31:13,264
That's four months without
the medicine you need.

594
00:31:16,976 --> 00:31:18,602
I'm willing to let your child

595
00:31:18,602 --> 00:31:21,522
wither and die inside you
if that's what's required.

596
00:31:21,647 --> 00:31:23,899
But neither of us wants that.

597
00:31:25,317 --> 00:31:28,946
Now tell me, am I really the
sort of enemy you want to make?

598
00:31:29,947 --> 00:31:32,533
But here's the alternative:

599
00:31:33,868 --> 00:31:36,203
this office, this staff,

600
00:31:38,956 --> 00:31:41,125
The CWI could be yours,

601
00:31:41,166 --> 00:31:44,044
and you and me, we wash
our hands of each other.

602
00:31:44,545 --> 00:31:46,338
- You're trying to buy me.
- No.

603
00:31:46,380 --> 00:31:48,883
When we first met, I
promised to empower you.

604
00:31:49,008 --> 00:31:50,384
I'm fulfilling that promise.

605
00:31:50,426 --> 00:31:52,636
- How do I get screwed?
- You don't. I resign.

606
00:31:52,678 --> 00:31:54,680
You take my place.

607
00:31:55,890 --> 00:31:58,142
- No strings?
- None.

608
00:31:58,434 --> 00:32:00,978
<i>[man on radio] Exit polls have

615
00:32:15,868 --> 00:32:17,745

617
00:32:19,955 --> 00:32:21,165

619
00:32:24,627 --> 00:32:27,796
Please tell Dr. Larson I
appreciate all her consultation,

620
00:32:27,838 --> 00:32:30,674
but I've put a great
deal of thought into this

621
00:32:30,716 --> 00:32:33,552
and I won't be pursuing any further tests.

622
00:32:33,594 --> 00:32:35,512
Thank you.

623
00:34:08,105 --> 00:34:10,691
[Frank] Have you thought
about what we discussed?

624
00:34:10,983 --> 00:34:14,236
I think you're right. We
should start with a clean state.

625
00:34:15,279 --> 00:34:17,739
What about our text messages?

626
00:34:22,327 --> 00:34:25,289
[phone beeps]

627
00:34:26,582 --> 00:34:28,667
And the contact.

628
00:34:31,503 --> 00:34:34,047
[phone beeps]

629
00:34:36,049 --> 00:34:38,802
- Are we good?
- Yeah.

630
00:34:38,802 --> 00:34:41,054
We can put all this
other nonsense behind us

631
00:34:41,096 --> 00:34:43,974
and trust one another and
continue to help one another?

632
00:34:44,016 --> 00:34:46,310
I'd like that.

633
00:34:46,602 --> 00:34:48,604
Then consider the slate clean.

634
00:34:48,729 --> 00:34:50,731
Answer me one thing.

635
00:34:50,856 --> 00:34:52,399
The passenger seat?

636
00:34:52,524 --> 00:34:54,359
You said Russo was trying to get out,

637
00:34:54,401 --> 00:34:55,986
but there was nothing abnormal...

638
00:34:56,028 --> 00:34:57,613
- I thought we just agreed...
- I want to believe you,

639
00:34:57,654 --> 00:34:59,031
But I need details,

640
00:34:59,031 --> 00:35:01,033
more than what you're sharing.

641
00:35:01,033 --> 00:35:02,200
What's your question?

642
00:35:02,242 --> 00:35:03,952
The night Russo fell off the wagon,

643
00:35:03,994 --> 00:35:05,621
he was at a fund-raiser,

644
00:35:05,662 --> 00:35:08,916
- the McNeally Cancer Institute.
- All in the police report.

645
00:35:11,251 --> 00:35:14,338
Rachel Posner was at the hotel that night.

646
00:35:14,463 --> 00:35:16,465
Who's that?

647
00:35:16,506 --> 00:35:18,842
The call girl who was with
Russo when he was arrested.

648
00:35:18,884 --> 00:35:20,928
I didn't know her name.

649
00:35:21,720 --> 00:35:24,056
She disappeared, Francis.

650
00:35:24,723 --> 00:35:26,016
When?

651
00:35:26,058 --> 00:35:27,601
Don't act surprised.

652
00:35:27,643 --> 00:35:29,478
I showed the bellmen a photo.

653
00:35:29,603 --> 00:35:31,647
One of them remembers seeing her.

654
00:35:31,772 --> 00:35:35,233
The girl's a prostitute. I'm
sure she frequents many hotels.

655
00:35:35,359 --> 00:35:37,653
But that hotel on that night?

656
00:35:37,694 --> 00:35:40,656
Well, now you sound
like Ms. Skorsky talking.

657
00:35:41,365 --> 00:35:43,575
I haven't discussed this with anyone.

658
00:35:43,700 --> 00:35:45,369
I wanted to ask you first.

659
00:35:45,494 --> 00:35:47,704
I have no idea what happened that night

660
00:35:47,704 --> 00:35:49,706
except that Peter started drinking again.

661
00:35:49,748 --> 00:35:53,126
I don't know who was or
wasn't there. I wish I was.

662
00:35:53,168 --> 00:35:54,795
Maybe I could've stopped him.

663
00:35:54,920 --> 00:35:56,922
Do you know where Rachel is?

664
00:35:56,963 --> 00:36:00,425
- Listen to what I am saying.
- I'm trying to protect us both.

665
00:36:00,634 --> 00:36:02,219
These are questions anyone could ask.

666
00:36:02,219 --> 00:36:04,763
But no one is except you.

667
00:36:04,888 --> 00:36:07,265
I can't imagine what you're after.

668
00:36:07,307 --> 00:36:09,351
I took a chance,

669
00:36:09,393 --> 00:36:12,896
showed up at your house and
placed myself at your feet.

670
00:36:13,021 --> 00:36:14,940

professionally, physically,

672
00:36:18,402 --> 00:36:20,946
and I hold myself accountable for that.

673
00:36:21,154 --> 00:36:23,615
Those were my choices
and I can live with them.

674
00:36:25,117 --> 00:36:26,493
I'd like to move forward,

675
00:36:26,535 --> 00:36:29,955
but I need to know exactly
what I was a part of, that...

676
00:36:31,415 --> 00:36:33,750
that I wasn't a part of someone's...

677
00:36:36,169 --> 00:36:38,797
Finish your thought.

678
00:36:40,882 --> 00:36:43,343
A part of someone's murder.

679
00:36:43,468 --> 00:36:44,719

- I've been calling you.

690

Come here.

691
00:39:43,189 --> 00:39:46,860
Come in. Sit down. Um...

692
00:39:46,985 --> 00:39:52,824
You want something? Some water or... juice?

693
00:39:58,663 --> 00:40:00,707
You going somewhere?

694
00:40:01,749 --> 00:40:03,585
Hey. You going somewhere?

695
00:40:03,585 --> 00:40:06,004
To my mom's. In Ithaca.

696
00:40:06,796 --> 00:40:08,923
- What?
- I'm leaving.

697
00:40:08,923 --> 00:40:12,177
No, no. No, no, no. No. No way.

698
00:40:12,302 --> 00:40:14,512
- We have nothing.
- Are you giving up on this?

699
00:40:14,637 --> 00:40:16,556
There are only three people in the world

700
00:40:16,556 --> 00:40:18,933
that know what he has done,
and one of them is gone.

701
00:40:19,058 --> 00:40:20,185
If we had anything,

702
00:40:20,226 --> 00:40:22,103
Lucas, any hard evidence,

703
00:40:22,145 --> 00:40:23,646
or even a fucking quote

704
00:40:23,646 --> 00:40:25,440
from a source that would
go on record for us,

705
00:40:25,440 --> 00:40:26,608
that would be one thing,

706
00:40:26,608 --> 00:40:27,942
but we're grasping,

707
00:40:27,942 --> 00:40:29,694
and he is not fucking around.

708
00:40:29,819 --> 00:40:33,031
You were the one who
told Zoe to pursue this.

709
00:40:33,156 --> 00:40:34,407
She told me what you said:

710
00:40:34,407 --> 00:40:37,368
"The only stories that mattered were
the ones that scared you to death."

711
00:40:37,410 --> 00:40:39,370
Ok, this isn't just death threats!

712
00:40:39,495 --> 00:40:40,914
This is real!

713
00:40:41,206 --> 00:40:43,917
He doesn't know about
you, but he knows about me.

714
00:40:44,042 --> 00:40:45,668
These were in my mailbox.

715
00:40:45,710 --> 00:40:47,629
No return address.

716
00:40:47,670 --> 00:40:49,756
- He took these of her?
- Who else?

717
00:40:49,881 --> 00:40:51,299
You can keep them,

718
00:40:51,341 --> 00:40:53,176
- but I don't think they're gonna help you.
- We need to stop him.

719
00:40:53,218 --> 00:40:55,303
Sick fucking shit.

720
00:40:55,428 --> 00:40:59,182
Janine, you cannot run away from this.

721
00:40:59,224 --> 00:41:00,975
My entire career,

722
00:41:01,017 --> 00:41:03,978
I have always chosen the tough stories.

723
00:41:04,103 --> 00:41:06,022
I have been fearless.

724
00:41:07,023 --> 00:41:08,983
But you know what?

725
00:41:09,108 --> 00:41:12,195
I'm really fucking scared this time.

726
00:41:12,528 --> 00:41:14,072
He's got power,

727
00:41:14,113 --> 00:41:15,531
he's got a lot to lose,

728
00:41:15,573 --> 00:41:17,575
- and right now he is winning.
- Please, I need your help, please...

729
00:41:17,617 --> 00:41:20,578
Just wake the fuck up, Lucas!

730
00:41:25,208 --> 00:41:28,169
[door opens, shuts]

731
00:41:30,713 --> 00:41:34,050
[sobbing]

732
00:41:38,638 --> 00:41:41,766
<i>[man on TV] The incident occurred

733
00:41:41,808 --> 00:41:43,017

<i>DC Police have ruled the death an accident.</i>

736
00:41:47,647 --> 00:41:51,317
<i>Zoe Barnes was a senior

737

<i>Previously, she worked

<i>[reporter continues]</i>

745
00:42:30,398 --> 00:42:32,859
What did you think of the files?

746
00:42:32,984 --> 00:42:35,862
- There's plenty to work with.
- Did you look at your own?

747
00:42:35,862 --> 00:42:38,072
There was nothing there.

748
00:42:39,323 --> 00:42:42,577
- Should there be?
- No.

749
00:42:43,077 --> 00:42:44,328
Even if you're lying,

750
00:42:44,370 --> 00:42:46,164
the fact I haven't been
able to find anything

751
00:42:46,205 --> 00:42:48,207
tells me you're very good
at covering your tracks.

752
00:42:48,249 --> 00:42:50,042
That's valuable to me.

753
00:42:50,084 --> 00:42:51,461
Here's our battleground.

754
00:42:51,461 --> 00:42:53,504
One hundred and 13 votes.

755
00:42:53,755 --> 00:42:55,882
You have the skeletons.

756
00:42:58,551 --> 00:43:00,386
If I lose,

757
00:43:00,511 --> 00:43:03,723
- they'll come after me.
- That's a risk you'll have to take.

758
00:43:04,682 --> 00:43:07,059
How do I know you're not just using me?

759
00:43:07,101 --> 00:43:09,103
Throwing a wrench into someone else's bid?

760
00:43:09,145 --> 00:43:10,605
That's another risk.

761
00:43:10,605 --> 00:43:13,691
The alternative is you wait ten years.

762
00:43:13,816 --> 00:43:15,610
You chose me for a reason.

763
00:43:16,402 --> 00:43:18,696
I'd like to know what it is.

764
00:43:19,197 --> 00:43:21,491
All right.

765
00:43:22,200 --> 00:43:24,619
How many missile strikes did you launch?

766
00:43:24,619 --> 00:43:27,455
- But you did it anyway.
- Enough to keep me awake at night.

767
00:43:27,497 --> 00:43:28,414
Yes, I did.

768
00:43:28,456 --> 00:43:30,833
- How many women and children?
- Too many.

769
00:43:30,958 --> 00:43:32,668
And you launched those missiles knowing

770
00:43:32,668 --> 00:43:34,003
all those innocent people would die.

771
00:43:34,045 --> 00:43:36,088
I had orders to eliminate the enemy.

772
00:43:36,130 --> 00:43:38,925
Which you carried out
expertly and efficiently.

773
00:43:39,842 --> 00:43:41,761
Have you ever killed anyone?

774
00:43:42,845 --> 00:43:44,180
No.

775
00:43:44,222 --> 00:43:47,975
I watched. Apartment buildings,
entire villages... gone,

776
00:43:48,017 --> 00:43:49,810
like they were never there.

777
00:43:50,186 --> 00:43:52,897
I'd prefer not to talk about
it, if that's all right.

778
00:43:53,356 --> 00:43:58,444
You did what needed to be done
and that's why I chose you, Jackie.

779
00:43:59,195 --> 00:44:01,030
Service background,

780
00:44:01,072 --> 00:44:02,573
clean history,

781
00:44:02,615 --> 00:44:04,909
photogenic. The whole package.

782
00:44:05,034 --> 00:44:07,620
But more importantly...

783
00:44:09,497 --> 00:44:11,874
ruthless pragmatism.

784
00:44:11,999 --> 00:44:14,710
Are we working together or not?

785
00:44:16,420 --> 00:44:19,215
Any public or private
endorsements for Buchwalter,

786
00:44:19,215 --> 00:44:20,174
I come out for Webb.

787
00:44:20,174 --> 00:44:22,301
I'll stay out of the
fray. I give you my word.

788
00:44:22,301 --> 00:44:23,511
Same goes for you, Terry.

789
00:44:23,552 --> 00:44:25,054
All right.

790
00:44:29,308 --> 00:44:31,477
Thank you, Christina.

791
00:44:33,646 --> 00:44:35,815
- Gentlemen.
- Mr. President,

792
00:44:35,856 --> 00:44:38,109
how was Pennsylvania?

793
00:44:46,701 --> 00:44:48,327
[keys jingling]

794
00:44:48,327 --> 00:44:50,454
[door opens]

795
00:45:00,715 --> 00:45:02,675
You like Indian?

796
00:45:23,446 --> 00:45:25,740
[Meechum] Sir? I've seen the news.

797
00:45:27,658 --> 00:45:29,869
I know she was close to you.

798
00:45:32,246 --> 00:45:34,749
Terrible tragedy.

799
00:45:35,583 --> 00:45:38,252
I spoke to Special Agent
Rockland today, sir.

800
00:45:38,544 --> 00:45:40,463
I begin my training next week.

801
00:45:40,713 --> 00:45:42,590
Very good.

802
00:45:47,595 --> 00:45:49,263
I know it's a day late.

803
00:45:49,263 --> 00:45:51,098
Hope it isn't inappropriate,

804
00:45:51,140 --> 00:45:53,684
but I wanted to give you this.

805
00:45:57,605 --> 00:45:59,440
Thank you, Meechum.

806
00:46:09,283 --> 00:46:10,785
That was very nice of Edward.

807
00:46:10,910 --> 00:46:13,788
He shouldn't have spent
this sort of money on me.

808
00:46:13,996 --> 00:46:15,706
I've opened some wine downstairs.

809
00:46:15,748 --> 00:46:17,833
I'll be down in a minute.

810
00:46:21,462 --> 00:46:24,340
Did you think I'd forgotten you?

811
00:46:25,007 --> 00:46:27,134
Perhaps you hoped I had.

812
00:46:27,259 --> 00:46:30,012
Don't waste a breath mourning Ms. Barnes.

813
00:46:30,012 --> 00:46:32,264
Every kitten grows up to be a cat.

814
00:46:32,306 --> 00:46:34,266
They seem so harmless at first,

815
00:46:34,266 --> 00:46:37,686
small, quiet, lapping
up their saucer of milk.

816
00:46:37,811 --> 00:46:39,980
But once their claws get long enough,

817
00:46:40,022 --> 00:46:41,774
they draw blood,

818
00:46:41,899 --> 00:46:44,485
sometimes from the hand that feeds them.

819
00:46:44,610 --> 00:46:47,613
For those of us climbing to
the top of the food chain,

820
00:46:47,613 --> 00:46:49,573
there can be no mercy.

821
00:46:49,615 --> 00:46:51,534
There is but one rule:

822
00:46:51,534 --> 00:46:55,037
hunt or be hunted.

823
00:46:56,413 --> 00:46:58,582
Welcome back.
